*[complete 19 Sept 19] Fix ties in T25 rankings
	* See UGA & Florida in final 2018 rankings. Tied @ 7 but gives one 7 and one 8. Make 7.5
	* Or week 4 2019. Wisconsin Penn St tie at 13. Gives one 13 & one 14. Same conference so OK but should be 13.5
	* Problem resolved
		* Working for +2 way tie. 
		* Pending for 3+ way tie, but no T25 sample for that yet. Code should be able to handle it. Check
		* Still issues with ties @ #25 concerning ORVs; see below. 
	* Problem resurfaced with ESPN HTML code change after release of week 5 2019
		* Resolved 25 Sept 19

* Fix ties when they occur at #25
	* See 2019 week 2. Iowa St-Nebraska tie. only gives 1st one listed the 25, omits the second listed one, and moves others receiving votes up one (UVA should be 27th but is given 26pts)
	* Current (Sept 2019) efforts to resolve all top 25 teams identify teams tied at 25 too. 
		* Top 25 ties everywhere, including at #25, fixed (19 Sept 19)
	* But the others receiving votes still starts at 26 regardless. Fix
		* Itterate through t25 inverse dict. If any value from that dict is > 25, you know you have to start after 26. Ie a val of 25.5 means others RV would start @ 27.
			* if score > 25, add team to list. len(list) + 25 = number you start at. 
			* in ex above, 2 teams' scores are > 25. 2 teams append to holder_list. len(holder_list) = 2. 25+2 = 27. ORV stars @ 27.

* Make sure Miami is picked up by ACC, T A&M by SEC
	* Multiple forms of Texas A&M. Make sure all are picked up. 

* Add README.md. Make Git Hub Repo more professional for others to use.
	* Sub directories for personal files like .docx full of scratch code.

* Black all the code to standardize formatting.
	* Generally clean the code

* Note: Only years 2014 and on have 'others receiving votes' (ORV) data.

* Fix the default URL that's generated to be http://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/1/


LONG TERM
---------
* Move to using the actual AP website instead of relying on ESPN's 3rd party. 
	* Can you get historical data doing this? 
	* Simple, current poll: https://www.apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll
	* Detailed poll: 


POSSIBLE
--------
* Put rankings into a postgresql database for easier manipulation and stats building?

* Statistical tests on significances of findings?
