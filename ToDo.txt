URGENT
------
* Make an entry argument of 'current' work regardless of year. 

* Fix pandas copying warning in Top25ToTable.py
	* C:/Users/acc-s/Documents/Python/AP_XC/Top25ToTable.py:66: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
		A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
		Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead
		See the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy
		powerfive_tocopy[cll] = powerfive_tocopy[cll].apply(lambda x: '{0:0>4}'.format(x))

* Move bottom opperations of Top25InPython.py into functions
	* Maybe change .py name to better reflect everything.
	* Reorganize where and when everything is called? 

* Make sure Miami is picked up by ACC, T A&M by SEC
	* Multiple forms of Texas A&M. Make sure all are picked up. 
	* Top25InPython.py line 47
	* Miami Ohio listed as "Miami (OH)" while Miami FL is defaulted at "Miami"
		* https://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/1/week/1/year/2003/seasontype/3
		* Running Top25InPython.py with only top25dict for 2003 poll above shows both Miami FL as "Miami" default and "Miami (OH)" are picked up by their respective conferences. 
			* IE Miami problem is fixed already :)		
	* T A&M:
		* Can you have multiple versions of the team in the vars .py and it still work ok?

* Add README.md. Make Git Hub Repo more professional for others to use.
	* Sub directories for personal files like .docx full of scratch code.

* Black all the code to standardize formatting.
	* Generally clean the code

* [completed 27 Oct 2019] Only years 2014 and on have 'others receiving votes' (ORV) data.
	* Write exception in mergedict that won't error out but will notify user of this fact.
		* This would only use rankings 1-25 for the scoring. 

* Fix the default URL that's generated to be http://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/1/
	* Isn't this done? (-10 Nov 2019)

* Try adding all vote totals and aggregate by conference 
	* IE this would be a ratio rather than an ordinal-interval measurement. Definately prizes top teams. 


LONG TERM
---------
* Try using different source for AP Rankings instead of relying on ESPN's 3rd party. 
	* Why?
		* Might offer more code stability than ESPN
		* Wouldn't have the before 2014 ORV problem maybe. 
	* Potential Sources:
		* Actual AP Poll website?
			* *** Can you get historical data doing this? *** Million dollar Q.
			* Simple, current poll: https://www.apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll
			* Detailed poll: 
				* May not exist any more. A podcast suggested Reddit. Would be a bear to beautiful soup though...
			* See point below about using pandas to get top 25; makes this easier.
		* Other source? 

* Try using pandas to grab the top 25
	* https://medium.com/@ageitgey/quick-tip-the-easiest-way-to-grab-data-out-of-a-web-page-in-python-7153cecfca58
		>>> tables = pd.read_html("<url>")
		>>> print(tables[0])
	* Method worked well in init trial
	* dependent on python 3
	
* Move project to python 3

* Continue to include the AAC?


POSSIBLE
--------
* Put rankings into a postgresql database for easier manipulation and stats building?
	* Or simple creation of csv of rankings to put into git repo where you could source the rankings locally.
		* Then add week-by-week somehow. 		

* Statistical tests on significances of findings? 


COMPLETE
--------
*[complete 19 Sept 19] Fix ties in T25 rankings
	* See UGA & Florida in final 2018 rankings. Tied @ 7 but gives one 7 and one 8. Make 7.5
	* Or week 4 2019. Wisconsin Penn St tie at 13. Gives one 13 & one 14. Same conference so OK but should be 13.5
	* Problem resolved
		* Working for +2 way tie. 
		* Pending for 3+ way tie, but no T25 sample for that yet. Code should be able to handle it. Check
		* Still issues with ties @ #25 concerning ORVs; see below. 
			* Problem fixed 25 Sept 19
	* Problem resurfaced with ESPN HTML code change after release of week 5 2019
		* Resolved 25 Sept 19

* [complete 25 Sept 19] Fix ties when they occur at #25
	* See 2019 week 2. Iowa St-Nebraska tie. only gives 1st one listed the 25, omits the second listed one, and moves others receiving votes up one (UVA should be 27th but is given 26pts)
	* Current (Sept 2019) efforts to resolve all top 25 teams identify teams tied at 25 too. 
		* Top 25 ties everywhere, including at #25, fixed (19 Sept 19)
	* But the others receiving votes still starts at 26 regardless. Fix
		* Itterate through t25 inverse dict. If any value from that dict is > 25, you know you have to start after 26. Ie a val of 25.5 means others RV would start @ 27.
			* if score > 25, add team to list. len(list) + 25 = number you start at. 
			* in ex above, 2 teams' scores are > 25. 2 teams append to holder_list. len(holder_list) = 2. 25+2 = 27. ORV stars @ 27.
	* Problem resolved	
		* Week 2 2019 splits tie btwn Nebraska and Iowa St. at 25.5 and starts UVA @ 27.
