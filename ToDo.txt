URGENT
------
* Fix ties when they occur at #25
	* See 2019 week 2. Iowa St-Nebraska tie. only gives 1st one listed the 25, omits the second listed one, and moves others receiving votes up one (UVA should be 27th but is given 26pts)

* Make sure Miami is picked up by ACC, T A&M by SEC
	* Multiple forms of Texas A&M. Make sure all are picked up. 

* Add README.md. Make Git Hub Repo more professional for others to use.
	* Sub directories for personal files like .docx full of scratch code.

* Get Pandas printout to match Excel format so you can copy and paste directly into excel. 
	* Identify other conferences that aren't Power 5 as a note if they score. 

* Black all the code to standardize formatting.
	* Generally clean the code

* Fix 2-way ties in T25 rankings
	* See UGA & Florida in final 2018 rankings. Tied @ 7 but gives one 7 and one 8. Make 7.5

* Fix 3(+) way ties in Top 25
	* This problem is only in the Top 25; ORV is fine with any # of ties (See preseason 2019 ORV: 4-way tie divides perfectly)

* Note: Only years 2014 and on have 'others receiving votes' (ORV) data.

* Fix the default URL that's generated to be http://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/1/


LONG TERM
---------
* Move to using the actual AP website instead of relying on ESPN's 3rd party. 
	* Can you get historical data doing this? 
	* Simple, current poll: https://www.apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll
	* Detailed poll: 


POSSIBLE
--------
* Put rankings into a postgresql database for easier manipulation and stats building?

* Statistical tests on significances of findings?
